== About This WorkShop

This workshop provides a high-level walkthrough of the OpenShift security measures, including solutions for the host layer, the
container and orchestration layer, and the build and application layer. 


== Introduction

Securing containers is a lot like securing any running process. You need to think about security
throughout the layers of the solution stack before you deploy and run your container. You also need
to think about security throughout the application and container life cycle.

This workshop will cover the following topics:

- Container Host & Multi Tenancy.
- Trusted Sources.
- Secure Access to Container Images.
- Security and the Build Process.
- Controling what can be deployed within a cluster.
- Securing the container Platform.
- Network Security for Apps on Openshift.
- Secure the Data.
- API Management and SSO.
- Introduction to GitOPS.

== What Are Containers?

Containers have broad appeal because they allow users to easily package an application, and
all its dependencies, into a single image that can be promoted from development, to test, and
to production â€” without change. Containers make it easy to ensure consistency across environ-
ments and multiple deployment targets like physical servers, virtual machines (VMs), and private
or public clouds. This helps teams more easily develop and manage the applications that deliver
business value.

Some of the benefits of using containers include:

|INFRASTRUCTURE |APPLICATIONS

|Sandboxed application processes on a shared Linux OS kernel
|Package my application and all of its dependencies

|Simpler, lighter, and denser than virtual machines
|Deploy to any environment in seconds and enable CI/CD

|Portable across different environments
|Easily access and share containerized components

== Container Security in OpenShift

This workshop describes the key elements of security for each layer of the
container solution stack, while also showing how OpenShift can be used to
to create, deploy, and manage containers at scale, with security in mind at
every stage and every layer.

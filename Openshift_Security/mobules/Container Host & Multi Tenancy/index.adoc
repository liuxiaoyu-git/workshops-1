== Multi-tenancy: Virtualization Versus Containers

Traditional virtualization also enables multi-tenancy, but in a very different
way from containers. Virtualization relies on a hypervisor spinning up guest
virtual machines (VMs), each of which has its own operating system (OS), as well
as the running application and its dependencies.

With VMs, the hypervisor isolates the guests from each other and from the host
kernel. Fewer individuals and processes have access to the hypervisor, reducing
the attack surface on the physical server. That said, security must still be
monitored: one guest VM may be able to use hypervisor bugs to gain access to
another VM or the host kernel. And, when the OS needs patching, it must be
patched on all guest VMs using that OS.

Containers can be run inside guest VMs, and there may be use cases where this is
desirable. For example, you may be deploying a traditional application in a
container, perhaps in order to lift-and-shift an application to the cloud.
However, container multi-tenancy on a single host provides a more lightweight,
flexible, and easier-to-scale deployment solution. This deployment model is
particularly appropriate for cloud-native applications.

== What Are Containers?

Containers have broad appeal because they allow users to easily package an application, and
all its dependencies, into a single image that can be promoted from development, to test, and
to production â€” without change. Containers make it easy to ensure consistency across environ-
ments and multiple deployment targets like physical servers, virtual machines (VMs), and private
or public clouds. This helps teams more easily develop and manage the applications that deliver
business value.

Some of the benefits of using containers include:

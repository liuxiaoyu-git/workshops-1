= UTS Namespace

The Unix Time Sharing (UTS) Namespace exists solely for storing the system's hostname. Seriously. A whole namespace to store one string. 
This namespace has a long history and has changed quite a bit along the way. It exists the way it is for historical reasons.

Let's create a sandbox with a new UTS Namespace.

```
unshare -u /bin/bash
```

Now let's change our hostname.

```
hostname sandbox
hostname
```

Cool! That worked exactly as expected. But what is the hostname on our host? 
Switch terminals to one that is in the native namespaces and check.

```
hostname
```

It is unchanged! 
On the terminal that is in the new namespaces, type exit to return to the native namespaces.
